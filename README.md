# spreadr-python
This package is the Python version of Cynthia Siew's spreadr package, which is written in R. Documentation and source code can be found here: https://github.com/csqsiew/spreadr 

The notion of spreading activation is a prevalent metaphor in the cognitive sciences. This package provides the tools for cognitive scientists and psychologists to conduct computer simulations that implement spreading activation in a network representation. The algorithmic method implemented in spreadr subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (2011, Frontiers), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could spread among nodes that were connected to each other via edges or connections (i.e., a network). See Vitevitch, M. S., Ercal, G., & Adagarla, B. (2011).

# getting started
## prerequisites
There are a few Python libraries that need to be installed, in order for the package to function: NumPy, Pandas, and NetworkX. They can all be installed with pip by executing the pip install command as shown below:

```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install networkx
```
If the above commands do not work, try replacing "pip" with "pip3". 
## installation
spreadr-python repo can be cloned:
```
git clone https://github.com/sofiechung/spreadr-python.git
```
Alternatively, source files of the most recent commit can just be directly downloaded.

# spreadr function
## arguments
**network**: A database which represents the nodes and edges of the network that spreading activation will be applied to. Networks can have either directed/undirected edges, and they can also be weighted. Can be a Pandas dataframe, NumPy ndarray, or NetworkX graph. Here is the same network in three different formats:
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

panda = pd.Dataframe(data = [[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,0]],
                  columns = ['node1','node2','node3'],
                    index = ['node1','node2','node3'])
                         
numpy = np.array([[0,1,1],
                  [1,0,0],
                  [1,0,0]])

networkx = nx.Graph()
networkx.add_nodes_from(['node1','node2','node3'])
networkx.add_edges_from([('node1','node2'),('node1','node3')])
nx.set_edge_attributes(network, {('node1','node2'):{'weight':1},('node1','node3'):{'weight':1}})                  
```
The above examples represent a 3x3 network with connections between ('node1', 'node2') and ('node1', 'node3'). Note that the rows and columns in NumPy arrays cannot be named, so if your nodes have specific names, it may be better to use either a Pandas dataframe or NetworkX graph. And if you want to set weights to specific edges, use a NetworkX graph. 

**start_run**: A Pandas dataframe which contains the activation values assigned to specific nodes at time t = 0. Here is an example input:
```
init_act = {'node':[0],'activation':[20]}
example_start_run = pd.Dataframe(data = init_act)
```
The above example indicates that at time t = 0, we want to apply activation value 20 to node 0 in our network. 

**retention**: The proportion of activation retained in the originator node (ranges from 0 to 1). Default is 0.5. 

**time**: The number of times to run the spreading activation process. Default is 10. 

**threshold_to_stop**: An integer indicating how many time steps should spreading activation run for. Default is None.

**decay**: The proportion of activation lost at each time step (ranges from 0 to 1). Default is 0.

**suppress**: Nodes with activation values lower than this value will have their activations forced to 0. Typically this will be a very small value (e.g., < .001). Default is 0.

**include_t0**: A boolean where TRUE indcates that the output will include time t=0, and FALSE indicates that the ouput will not include time t=0. Default is False.

**never_stop**: A boolean where TRUE indicates for the program to continue running, even if there is an infinite loop, and FALSE indicates for the program to terminate once > 10000 iterations have passed. Default is False.

## output
The spreadr function will return a Pandas dataframe of the network which maps each node to their activation value at every timestep. Here is an example output:
```
  node  activation  time
0    a        10.0     0
1    b         0.0     0
2    c         0.0     0
3    a         0.0     1
4    b         1.0     1
5    c         9.0     1
```
### modified output
The spreadr-python package includes two additional functions which modifies the original output of the spreadr function. These are especially useful for extremely large networks:

**extract_specific**: This function will print a specified node's activation value at a specified time.

**extract_all**: This function will print either all the activation values for a specified node or all the activation values for a specified time, or both.

### output notes
As is, the spreadr function's output rounds all activation values up to 10 decimal points, as shown below with the **round** function:
```
  d = {'node': nodes, 'activation': [round(elem,10) for elem in activations], 'time': times}
  return_df = pd.DataFrame(data=d)
```
This can obviosuly be modified to however the user sees fit, but just note that the test file **spreadr_test.py** will only pass all test cases with the above format. 

# roadmap
- [ ] Implement Cython package into **create_mat_t.py** to decrease runtime for extremely large networks.
- [ ] Create a function which outputs a visual simulation of the spreading activation for a network.
