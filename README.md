# spreadr-python
This package is the Python version of Cynthia Siew's spreadr package, which is written in R. Documentation and source code can be found here: https://github.com/csqsiew/spreadr

The notion of spreading activation is a prevalent metaphor in the cognitive sciences. This package provides the tools for cognitive scientists and psychologists to conduct computer simulations that implement spreading activation in a network representation. The algorithmic method implemented in spreadr subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (2011, Frontiers), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could spread among nodes that were connected to each other via edges or connections (i.e., a network). See Vitevitch, M. S., Ercal, G., & Adagarla, B. (2011).

# installation
spreadr-python repo can be directly downloaded from github. There are also a few Python libraries that need to be installed, in order for the package to function: NumPy, Pandas, and NetworkX. They can all be installed with pip by executing the pip install command as shown below:

```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install networkx
```

If the above commands do not work, try replacing "pip" with "pip3".
